    "title": "So where does the data take me?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I just finished a week at NENA’s Standard and Best Practices. I had a wonderful time with my presentations on developing staffing models, data management, and using data better in call processing. I met a lot of new friends and I see a lot of opportunities ahead of me to make a real difference at the intersection of public safety and data science.\nThis is, however, where I’m going to get on my soapbox and address something I am hearing more and more of, not only in the centres, but in civic government as well. I admit that I have phrases and words that I don’t like and that I will not use or accept from others when we’re working on projects. In statistics, I hate the word average. It’s meaningless. Define which measure of central tendency you mean and stick with it. If the distribution is normally distributed, then stick with the mean and call it such. If it’s not, then choose either the median or the mode. I prefer the median myself, but don’t use average.\nWhen it comes to Analytics, I hate hearing anyone say Trust Me. I do not want blind trust in anyone, including me. I should have to prove what I assert. Yes, I do know my business, but I’m fallable just like anyone else.\nThe other phrase that I fear is being overused is data-driven. I am concerned that it’s becoming a buzz phrase rather than being looked at in depth. My opinion here, and only my opinion, is that this along with “Data is the new oil” is becoming meaningless because it’s being used without thought. I prefer using information-driven or intelligence-driven. When I was in the middle of my first Masters, I had an instructor who was studying knowledge management and he gave us really good definitions of data, information, and intelligence. We were taught that data is the raw material. Much like oil, if you want to continue with that metaphor. Information is data in context. Intelligence is application of information to a specific situation. During the week in Clearwater, I heard someone start the “oil” quote and finished it this way, Data like oil is the raw product, until it is extracted and transformed, it has limited value. Once it’s processed into something else, information, then it acquires a value. That’s why I prefer to use information-driven. I work with you to put the data into context and then generate information that you can apply as actionable intelligence.\n\n\nI participated in seven presentations. I will upload slide decks and notes later for people who are interested in learning what I was talking about in detail. Three of these were in a block discussing the need for a new staffing model recommendation in 911 centres. Currently, NENA’s Staffing Recommendations are over 21 years old and rely heavily on the Erlang-C model for staffing recommendations. There has been a tonne of work in queuing theory since the development of this formula. And, as referenced in the linked paper, there are legitimate questions about how appropriate the Erlang model family is for regular call centres, let alone 911 centres.\nTwo of the other presentations centered around the Emergency Incident Data Object. This is how, we propose, to move information between different systems and entities in public safety. It’s in a JSON object that leverages NIEM to define the objects passed between entities. My presentations dicussed the JSON object itself and the conveyance mechanisms by which the JSON objects are moved between entities.\nThe other presentations in which I participated were the Call Processing working group where I am the ‘data SME’ and the Future Think committee’s Data Management and Presetation work. That was a fun panel discussion with a lot of great audience participation.\nI am heartened, as a data scientist working in public safety, to hear my colleagues in public safety acknowledging the need to use data analytics, regression modeling, predictive analytics, and forecasting to improve things for telecommunicators.\nThere is also a movement to start considering a shaerd data repository for research and analytical purposes. I beieve that will be an excellent idea. If we can get several PSAPs together and build out a research database, we could put it in front of other researchers and see where it leades us."

    "text": "So, over the dead week between Christmas and New Year’s Day, I started working on a new reporting template. The goal is to create a new archive of weekly and monthly reports for my 911 centre in a Quarto blog format. Currently, I’m working on a sample report for management to see what the audience will like. I also want to use the sample to illustrate what needs to happen with the reports.\nAn example of this is in our datasets, we trap the time stamps at various points in the life of the service call. Some of these include the start of the call, when it was available to be dispatched, when the first units were assigned, and when the call was disconnected. In the data cleaning process, we have identified some of the deltas between time stamps come out negative. Obviously, you cannot dispatch a call before it enters the queue. This means that when we find them, we have to address them in some fashion."

Over that time, I work to find new ways to use the data generated by PSAPs to help a center be better staffed, more responsive to the community, and to help the community discover issues that can be addressed to reduce calls to the center. During my tenure in public safety, I’ve worked as a CAD manager, DBA, Data Analyst, and a Data Scientist.\nI completed my PhD work at National University in Data Science. Most of my research concerned both Public Safety Emergency Communications Centers 911/999/112 systems and time series forecasting models. My dissertation evaluated the efficacy of automated forecasting libraries like Prophet or TimeGPT in building accurate forecasts for noisy multi-stochastic datasets like Emergency Communication Center call volumes."

    "text": "Well, the site is now live, thanks to Ionos’ technical support. I have to compliment the person who followed up with me today. He helped me get everything taken care of and get the site live and available for you to see. It’s nice to go from working to build it to seeing it out there where everyone else can see it and we can go on this journey together.\nI also want to thank Beartiz Milz for writing an awesome tutorial that helped me turn my limited knowledge of Quarto and my comfort with R into a website and blog to promote my work in 911 data science. I’m also using her tutorial to build a blog as a vehicle for new reports in my PSAP.\nFor the last 14 years, I’ve written reports for two different PSAPs and felt like my reports have not illuminated everything that the data has to offer. The weekly and monthly reports have been things I’ve been asked to develop. However, there is always so much more in the data which could be important. Can we use knowledge about what days and hours are busiest change how we schedule telecommunicators? Can we see training oportunities by focusing on how long it takes us to process specific call types? Are there hidden correlations in the data that we’ve been missing because we don’t see them? I’ve thought of these questions forever. Now that I’ve finished my doctorate, I want to spend the time investigating these and other questions.\nI think that I can build templates that I can share with other interested PSAPs and we can start building better reporting systems which can, by being served as dashboards and websites, make the reports more responsive while automating the delivery. I want to mke things easier for everyone.\nI updated my Medium site with an annoucement that this blog exists and has become active. I’ve also updated LinkedIn with a link to that article and invited my friends and contacts there to add comments and ask questions that can turn into blog posts. I will post this article there too, once I’ve published it.\nSo, this is where this post ends. I will post something new in a couple of days. I’m going to challenge myself to add some code in the next one to see what happens. I have a couple of ideas in mind."

She asked if I knew of a way to view all of the current calls for service throughout the state. No, she’s not crazy, she was investigating a request made of her. However, the commiunication started me thinking about an “end-to-end” data science solution that could make that a reality.\nThwew are severak steps that need to be taken to create such an application. Granted, the end result would be focused"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is, for me, a starting point post. I am just starting to develop this site, including this blog, as a way to do several things at once. First and foremost, I want to document my work in public safety communications data science. This is a turning point in my career, transitioning from back-end administration of dispatch systems to data analytics and data science.\nAnother part of this blog will discuss things I find interesting in tech, especially when it comes to data. For example, I have been working more and more in Python lately and finding tools that I enjoy using because they make my work easier. The top three of late are uv, DuckDB, and FireDucks. Over time, I will add Jupyter notebooks here so I can document my work with these and other tools.\nI also want to learn more about Julia. So I might experiment with it in notebooks as well here and there and document the experience. However, most of the code that you see here will be in R, because it was the first language that I learned and the one that I feel most comfortable with. That will present its own challenge because many forecasting libraries that I have worked with are only expressed in Python.\nThere will be some tutorials as I write more and I get more comfortable with writing here and updating the blog and the site. Most of those are going to be geared towards public safety communications. I work with NENA on several technical committees and part of that work, for me, focuses on bringing advanced analytics to PSAPs across the country. I also speak a few times a year on this and other topics. I will start blogging about what I have presented after the presentations are done. It will be good review.\nI am also fascinated with generating synthetic data for analyses. Right now, I’ve been working with Mostly.ai to generate synthetic data for my research work. Due to the nature of the work that I do in centres, I use synthetic data for my presentations and my tutorials. My goal is to work with other libraries to create more realistic data for research purposes. I know that I will write about that in future posts. I’m looking forward to having fun with that exploration.\nMany of my posts will be found on my Medium page. Some of the tutorials may also be found, in the future, on my LinkedIn. However, I will point my audience here over time because there will be posts here that don’t exist other places so I can promote this place as my prefered publication venue.\nWell, I think that this is a good start as a pre-launch blog post."
