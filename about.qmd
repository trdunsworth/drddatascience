### Basics
I am Dr. Tony Dunsworth. I have been working with data in public safety answering points (PSAPs) for nearly 15 years. Over that time, I work to find new ways to use the data generated by PSAPs to help a center be better staffed, more responsive to the community, and to help the community discover issues that can be addressed to reduce calls to the center. During my tenure in public safety, I've worked as a CAD manager, DBA, Data Analyst, and a Data Scientist.
