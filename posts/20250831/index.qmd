When I started actively working in data science, like everyone else, I heard the old maxim that a data scientist spends about 80% of their time cleaning data. Well, I can report that in many cases, that's true. I'm currently facing a lot of that right now in building a new dataset for some new reports and dashboards that I'm designing. I'm starting the data cleaning process in the [SQL](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/structured-query-language) statement. I believe that it's a lot faster.
