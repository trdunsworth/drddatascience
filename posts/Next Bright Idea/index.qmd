As most of you know, I have a few outside activities where I can use my skills to better things around me. For example, I contribute to first-look book reviews for [Manning Press](https://www.manning.com/). I am a subject matter expert for [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.com/) on a couple of different exams. I also volunteer my time and energy for [NENA](https://www.nena.org/), the National Emergency Number Association. I work on standards and best practice development there.
