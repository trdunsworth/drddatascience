About a month or so back, I had an opportunity to speak with several people from a company that makes software for public safety entities. I had connected with one of their folks through my [BlueSky account](trdunsworth.bsky.social). After a few preliminary conversations, they wanted to read my dissertation. Trust me folks, when someone asks to read it, you are truly excited. I sent them a copy of it and when it came time to meet with the group, I was excited to learn they **really did** read it!

When we met, they asked me a few questions about it. Overall, they appeared to be impressed with my work. However, the surprise came when I mentioned a small piece of *toy* software I have written. They were immediately interested in this software. They were thinking of new uses for it, beyond my reason for creating it, and asking questions about what I developed and why I made the design choices that I dud. 

Because I give many presentations around the country about statistics and data use, I use synthetic data in place of real data from a specfic centre for my presentations. It provides better compliance with CJIS and HIPAA regulations because I'm not potentially exposing anyone's data. Granted, I don't ever use the call narrative, but some systems may identify telecommunicators by name, and I don't want to expose that either. In the past, I used [Mostly.ai](https://mostly.ai/) as my first provider.
