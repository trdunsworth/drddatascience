## Who am I writing this for?

I have seen a lot of posts on LinkedIn lately discussing the differences between data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. Most of these posts are written by folks I follow in the data community and they give bullet point differences, including the technologies that each should learn. Those are great for discussion within the data community, specifically, how much of what we do bleeds over across those defined roles. Like many of my comrades in the data community, I've performed many of these roles across my journey. So, since one of my target audiences is the 9-1-1 community, I wanted to discuss these roles and how they all work together.
