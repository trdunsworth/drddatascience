## What and Why?

During my dissertation, I had to use Python to work with some of the time series forecasting libraries that I wished to test and evaluate as low-code solutions.During the process, I worked a lot of with [Google Colab](https://colab.google.com) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) to make sure that my research was reproducible for my committee. Afterwards, I stepped back out of that *sphere* and returned to Quarto and RStudio. and a focus on R.

Now I'm working on a new project that's going to need Quarto, but it really also needs Python for a few libraries that are going to be instrumental.
